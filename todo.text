Create Controller:

File Location: Place the controller in the Controllers directory.
Constructor Injection: Inject the service interface (e.g., IUserService) into the controller's constructor.
Action Methods: Define action methods (e.g., GetAllUsers) that call the appropriate service methods.
Annotations: Use [ApiController] and [Route("api/[controller]")] annotations to define the controller and route.
Create Service Interface:

File Location: Place the service interface in the Services directory.
Define Methods: Declare the methods that the service will implement (e.g., GetAllUsers).
Model Return Types: Use model types (e.g., IEnumerable<User>) as return types for methods.
Create Service Implementation:

File Location: Place the service implementation in the Services directory.
Constructor Injection: Inject the repository interface (e.g., IUserRepository) into the service's constructor.
Implement Methods: Implement the methods declared in the service interface by calling the repository methods.
Create Repository Interface:

File Location: Place the repository interface in the Repositories directory.
Define Methods: Declare the methods that the repository will implement (e.g., GetAllUsers).
Model Return Types: Use model types (e.g., IEnumerable<User>) as return types for methods.
Create Repository Implementation:

File Location: Place the repository implementation in the Repositories directory.
Implement Methods: Implement the methods declared in the repository interface. Use an in-memory list or actual database access logic.
Create Model:

File Location: Place the model classes in the Models directory.
Define Properties: Define properties for the model (e.g., Id, Name).
Register Services and Repositories in Startup.cs:

Add Scoped Services: In the ConfigureServices method, register the service and repository interfaces with their implementations (e.g., services.AddScoped<IUserService, UserService>()).
Configure appsettings.json:

Connection Strings: Add connection strings and other configuration settings.
Environment Variables: Ensure environment variables are configured to override settings when necessary.
Configure Program.cs:

Load Configuration: Use .ConfigureAppConfiguration to load settings from appsettings.json and environment variables.
Use Startup Class: Ensure the host builder uses the Startup class for configuring the application.
